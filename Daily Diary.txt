Week 1 29th Jan - 2nd Feb
Monday 29th
Start: 
Induction to VR room and initial meeting with supervisor.

End: 
Had meeting with supervisor, access to the VR room is coming soon.

Tuesday 30h
Start:
Research into Unity vs Unreal engine as to which is preferred engine (suspect Unity as I have experience in it)
Look into what libraries exist for starting VR development

End:
As expected, nothing about Unreal really pulls me to go against my natural instincts to use the familiar environment of Unity.
Steam VR for vive and VRTK as existing toolkits / SDKs. I found some great looking tutorials from developer of these named "StoneFox", watch these to get idea of capabilities so I don't reinvent the wheel

Wednesday 31st
Start:
Not working on MMP today

End:
" "

Thursday 1st
Start:
Do research on existing free VR games to see interaction methods and what feels good, what is fun, what seems doable

End:
Created "Doc of Thoughts" as minddump on what I was thinking while trying different games.

Friday 2nd
Start:
Another day researching existing VR experiences.

End:
More updates to "Doc of Thoughts"



Week 2 5th Feb - 9th Feb
Monday 5th
Start:
Begin writing Outline Project Spec, start creating SCRUM tasklist to work with

End:
Have Excel document to act as tasklist currently, there may be better way to do this.

Tuesday 6th
Start:
Writing project spec requires some idea of exact task to be tackled, so mindstorm possible game ideas.

End:
Created Unity3D project to write little spke solutions in. With this I created a GitHub to store the project.
My game idea moving forward for testing is to play a "dodgeball" style game, with enemy towers that fire balls at you, you must dodge and catch and throw them back to defeat them

Wednesday 7th
Start:
Work from home with Unity adding previously mentioned Steam VR and VRTK, write some basic C# scripts to manually play with component system in Unity

End:
I have some playable on desktop Unity project, with basic collision detection and "enemies".

Thursday 8th
Start:
Go to Campus to build and playtest basic VR interactions with hardware.

End:
Campus system out of date, could not test game with VR equipment. Instead played with example scenes from VRTK.

Friday 9th
Sart:
Go to Campus to build and playtest basic VR interactions with hardware.

End:
Can now playtest my own project within virtual reality, have working headset and controllers with playspace.

SPRINT SUMMARY
I like the format of this Daily Diary, it helps me to see what I planned on doing, and what I got done in short easy to parse form.
The tasklist is still giving me pause for thought, but I think getting used to the SCRUM way of working will make it 2nd nature sooner rather than later.
I have ordered a HTC Vive to arrive beginning next week so I can test from home and during out of hours times. This will be especially important come the Easter holidays
Next sprint I hope to have finished a simple, single level using my own code Unity to perform a couple of different tasks, to do with interaction and the worlds reaction.
Having an idea for my final idea, being a momentum based throwing game with different scenarios, gives me something to work towards, it may be too simple, may be too complex, but I can see how this progresses this sprint cycle to better size what I can achieve.

Week 3 12th Feb - 16th Feb
Monday 12th
Start:
Clean up and add all currently existing documents to GitHub, continue work on creating base physics of game.

End:
I collated and tidied up the documents which weren't on GitHub, including touching up the ReadMe and giving the TaskList some colour.

Tuesday 13
Start:
Install Vive at residance, get up and running.

End:
Tutorial with supervisor, idea of angular momentum as in space for artificial gravity came up. Vive recieved and installed at home.

Wednesday 14th
Start:
Ill day

End:

Thuhrsday 15th
Start:
Last couple of days were relativy unproductive, focus on working in Unity today with regard to throwing physics

End:
Spent most of day working with ray casting and becoming more familiar with object manipulation. Also used debug tools.
Found out the VR Simulator works VERY differently to the actual Vive. Need to work out why.

Friday 16th
Start:
Work out whats weird with real Vr interactions compared to Simulated VR

End:
Example scripts did not have interaction methods correctly implemented for Steam VR, manually assigning VRTK Interaction methods fixes problem.


Week 4 19th Feb - 23rd Feb
Monday 19th
Start:
Officially begin "Scene 1", with prototype assets.

End:
Lots of work on scaling and perception within VR, it's a surpringly tricky process. Have the field on which to build interactions now, with wonderful free colourful prototype assets from unity asset store.
