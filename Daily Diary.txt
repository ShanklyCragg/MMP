Week 1 29th Jan - 2nd Feb
Monday 29th
Start: 
Induction to VR room and initial meeting with supervisor.

End: 
Had meeting with supervisor, access to the VR room is coming soon.

Tuesday 30h
Start:
Research into Unity vs Unreal engine as to which is preferred engine (suspect Unity as I have experience in it)
Look into what libraries exist for starting VR development

End:
As expected, nothing about Unreal really pulls me to go against my natural instincts to use the familiar environment of Unity.
Steam VR for vive and VRTK as existing toolkits / SDKs. I found some great looking tutorials from developer of these named "StoneFox", watch these to get idea of capabilities so I don't reinvent the wheel

Wednesday 31st
Start:
Not working on MMP today

End:
" "

Thursday 1st
Start:
Do research on existing free VR games to see interaction methods and what feels good, what is fun, what seems doable

End:
Created "Doc of Thoughts" as minddump on what I was thinking while trying different games.

Friday 2nd
Start:
Another day researching existing VR experiences.

End:
More updates to "Doc of Thoughts"



Week 2 5th Feb - 9th Feb
Monday 5th
Start:
Begin writing Outline Project Spec, start creating SCRUM tasklist to work with

End:
Have Excel document to act as tasklist currently, there may be better way to do this.

Tuesday 6th
Start:
Writing project spec requires some idea of exact task to be tackled, so mindstorm possible game ideas.

End:
Created Unity3D project to write little spke solutions in. With this I created a GitHub to store the project.
My game idea moving forward for testing is to play a "dodgeball" style game, with enemy towers that fire balls at you, you must dodge and catch and throw them back to defeat them

Wednesday 7th
Start:
Work from home with Unity adding previously mentioned Steam VR and VRTK, write some basic C# scripts to manually play with component system in Unity

End:
I have some playable on desktop Unity project, with basic collision detection and "enemies".

Thursday 8th
Start:
Go to Campus to build and playtest basic VR interactions with hardware.

End:
Campus system out of date, could not test game with VR equipment. Instead played with example scenes from VRTK.

Friday 9th
Sart:
Go to Campus to build and playtest basic VR interactions with hardware.

End:
Can now playtest my own project within virtual reality, have working headset and controllers with playspace.

SPRINT SUMMARY
I like the format of this Daily Diary, it helps me to see what I planned on doing, and what I got done in short easy to parse form.
The tasklist is still giving me pause for thought, but I think getting used to the SCRUM way of working will make it 2nd nature sooner rather than later.
I have ordered a HTC Vive to arrive beginning next week so I can test from home and during out of hours times. This will be especially important come the Easter holidays
Next sprint I hope to have finished a simple, single level using my own code Unity to perform a couple of different tasks, to do with interaction and the worlds reaction.
Having an idea for my final idea, being a momentum based throwing game with different scenarios, gives me something to work towards, it may be too simple, may be too complex, but I can see how this progresses this sprint cycle to better size what I can achieve.

Week 3 12th Feb - 16th Feb
Monday 12th
Start:
Clean up and add all currently existing documents to GitHub, continue work on creating base physics of game.

End:
I collated and tidied up the documents which weren't on GitHub, including touching up the ReadMe and giving the TaskList some colour.

Tuesday 13
Start:
Install Vive at residance, get up and running.

End:
Tutorial with supervisor, idea of angular momentum as in space for artificial gravity came up. Vive recieved and installed at home.

Wednesday 14th
Start:
Ill day

End:

Thuhrsday 15th
Start:
Last couple of days were relativy unproductive, focus on working in Unity today with regard to throwing physics

End:
Spent most of day working with ray casting and becoming more familiar with object manipulation. Also used debug tools.
Found out the VR Simulator works VERY differently to the actual Vive. Need to work out why.

Friday 16th
Start:
Work out whats weird with real Vr interactions compared to Simulated VR

End:
Example scripts did not have interaction methods correctly implemented for Steam VR, manually assigning VRTK Interaction methods fixes problem.


Week 4 19th Feb - 23rd Feb
Monday 19th
Start:
Officially begin "Scene 1", with prototype assets.

End:
Lots of work on scaling and perception within VR, it's a surpringly tricky process. Have the field on which to build interactions now, with wonderful free colourful prototype assets from unity asset store.

Tuesday 20th
Start: Supervisor meeting, work on scene 1

End: Idea of centriguge / centripital forces from meeting, where ball appears to fall or bounce with a sidways motion to it like a circle.

Wednesday 21st
Start: Start work on Centripital force, and bouncy floors

End:
Custom controller commands for grip to reset ball posision, and "physics materials" experimentation.

Thursday 22nd
Start: See how difficult it is to add "Centripital forces" to Unity

End: Hard... no progress made with regards to implementation.

Friday 23rd
Start: Focus on interaction between ball and floor. Currently they "slide" over each other as if no friction.

End: Adding RigidBody to room fixes friction issue. The weight of ball must be smaller than floor to not fall through.


SPRINT SUMMARY
Most of the issues relating to angular physics are solved by doing things the "right way" in unity, and not from nice scripting.
All this "Momentum" and "centriguge" and all seems to be solved by the engine.
So finding something the engine DOESN'T do seems to be the key here is we want to follow this route.
I'm thinking spinning around on the inside of a cylinder, what happens if you throw the ball past the mid point?
I guess you lose it and it drops to the opposite side of the world.
This still seems to have very little in terms of coding to do.

Some more ideas totally different include being the "driver" of an old steam train, so the interactions include:
Shovelling coal into the furnace, this increases a gage with "fuel" on it, keeps the train running.
Pumping water into a bucket, and emptying bucket into the water tank. Again with another gage for feedback.
(Too much water reduces fuel as engine not as efficient, too much coal burns all water very quick)
Holes might appear in the water pipe, and you'd have to use some tape in the area to fix it.
Balencing these 3 acts might be enough.


Week5 26th Feb - 2nd Mar
Monday 26th
Start:
Work on new idea. Again. Playing with triggers and user friendly interaction as key ala cooking simulator.

End:
Cleaned up scene with working inertia/angular momentum. Worked on "SteamTrain" scene, added coal spawner and trigger, with shovel interaction.

Tuesday 27th
Start: No MMP work today

End: ""

Wednesday 28th
Start: Work on Guage for coal interaction. With increasing difficulty.

End: Have basic guage working, with coal trigger connection.

Thursday 1st
Start: Implementing "temperature", start with it's interaction with coal first.

End: 2nd gauge for temperature with variable increases based on amount of coal added

Friday 2nd
Start: Work on poster for CS38220 assignment

End: Majority of text written for poster, 2 sections to be finished.

Week 6 5th Mar - 9th Mar
Monday 5th
Start: Create water spawner, and water entrance to pour in

End: Spent 90% of time reading about non-convex meshs. Bloody buckets. Think I'll have to make my own.

Tuesday 6th:
Start: No work today

End: ""

Wednesday 7th
Start: Manually create bucket, fix water causing FPS issues

End: Bucket added, water now despawns at ground level or after 13 seconds.

Thursday 8th
Start: Fixup poster writing and find references for further reading

End: Poster designed and finilized really well, happy with the outcome aesthetically and verbally.

Friday 9th
Start: Create custom furnace in Blender

End: This ended up being very unproductive, not going to focus on visuals anytime soon with the lack of progress here.


Week 7 12th Mar - 16th Mar
Monday 12th
Start: Create interaction with coal spawner "breaking" and needing to be hit to fix.

End: 3 htis to fix broken coal spawner.

Tuesday 13th
Start: Flesh out breaking of coal spawner with audio/visuals

End: Smoke now bellows from broken coal spawner

Wednesday 14th
Start: Work on audio for coal spawner, and reduce bloat of coal spawning scripts

End: Audio added for running and breaking

Thursday 15th
Start: Remodel space to allow for graphical expansions to outside scenary, and inside.

End: Thinned walles, moved and adapted gauges to fit.

Friday 16th
Start: Work more on decoupling actions from coal spawning script

End: No progress made with this, requires more refactoring efforts.

Week 8 19th Mar - 23rd Mar
Monday 19th Mar
Start: Prepare for MPD, begin refactoring events

End: Added EventManager and decoupled game elements

This week was dedicated to practising the Mid Project Demo, and working on a different modules assignment. No progress


Week 9 26th Mar - 30th Mar
Holiday

Week 10 2nd Apr - 6th Apr
Monday 2nd
Start: Create environment

End: Found ground, tree and train assets. Set out in a forest like scene.

Tuesday 3rd
Start: Work on procedural terrain generation through code

End: Generate terrain through code, deleting moving forest is having issues

Wednesday 4th
Start: Continue working on deleting forest as it moves away

End: This is turning out to be weirdly diffcult.

Thursday 5th
Start: ^^as above

End: ^^as above ahhh!

Friday 6th
Start: Change focus, move pre-existing code to event system

End: Added object to hand to eventmanager


Week 11 9th Apr - 13th Apr
Monday 9th
Start: 

End:

Tuesday 10th
Start: Come back to environment, isolate issue

End: IT WAS RIGIDBODIES THE WHOLE TIME AHHHHH. Making the trigger have a kinematic, rigidbody solved the issue. Rolling environments now working
Lots of different possible environment solutions. spinning world, deleting and re-adding forest. best solution is simplest, just move items back in position

Wednesday 11th
Start: Project has been oddly laggy since environment was introduced, work on reducing strain caused by environment

End: Trees had rigidbodies, and colliders. Removing these has drastically increased performance. Still a minor impact however.

Thursday 12th
Start: Sometimes trees can be seen to spawn, reposition to avoid. Begin adding "driver".

End: Moved forest to reduce pop-in. Changed physics properties of Water to improve FPS, slowed spawn by 50%.

Friday 13th
Start: Begin adding lever to water spawner.

End: Finished Ethics forms. Rotational values are weird, in inspecter they can be negative but in code always between 0-360. Restricting rotational movement is awkward because of this. Lever is physically functional.


Week 12 16th - 20th Apr
Monday 16th
Start: Get water lever working

End: Having it rotate like a lever is too difficult, instead just have it move up and down. Fixed bug with coal gauge overcharging. Worked on ending game play with speed/score interaction and gamestates.

Tuesday 17th
Start: Discuss progress with David Hunter.

End: Mentioned writing tests which I manually complete. Examples of these can be seen in completed past disertations from blackboard.

Wednesday 18th
Start: Add end game state, think about visual feedback of score to player

End: Just have text with score and speed displayed, with time as well.

Thursday 19th
Start: Finish work on end game state.

End: Game can now end and be restarted. Reduced total file size to ~600mb. Github still says 1.2gig because it still tracks deleted files. Added inheritance to Spawner objects

Friday 20th
Start: Thoroughly comment all code

End: All code commented with XML documentation. Added inheritance to text displays.
